<h2>3. TWO EXCELLENT DEMO COURSES </h2>
<p>If you have taken a course at edX.org, you have an idea of what this platform can offer.</p>
<p>Go through <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/edx/edx-edxdemo101-edx-demo-1038">this free demo course</a> in order to explore the edX learning experience.</p>
<p>In the demo you will find three sample weeks and lessons, containing  interactive tools, videos, readings, quizzes, questions, grading techniques and progress reports.</p>
<p>Another overview for a newbie is offered by Stanford University. Go to the left-hand column <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/info">on the Courseware page</a> to view the demo units.</p>
<p>To examine the outline of this demo course, click <a href="https://class.stanford.edu/courses/StanfordOnline/OpenEdX/Demo/4b33106cef2d4677931e6b01f31a608d/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>


&nbsp;
<h2>4. OPEN-SOURCE INITIATIVE </h2>
<p>MIT and Harvard, the creators of edX.org, released the software behind the educational portal as <a href="http://code.edx.org">open-source</a> in June of 2013.</p>
<p>Consequently, any skillful developer has been able to build a fully  brandable and customizable Open edX platform.</p>
<p>Code contributions are received every day, and innovation is non-stop. Open edX’s code is available under an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL license</a>. Keep in mind, however, that it requires you to make all of the code that modifies the core of the platform available as open source (this excludes XBlocks and JSinput). You can also sell a customized version of Open edX, as long as you release it.</p>
<p>As a not-for-profit enterprise composed of leading universities, the  xConsortium –which is behind edX.org and the Open edX software– is committed to an open-source vision.</p>
<p>Along with MIT and Harvard University, significant contributors to the Open edX initiative include Google, Stanford, UC Berkeley, the University of Queensland and Tsinghua University.</p>


&nbsp;
<h2>5. THE PLATFORM </h2>
<p>Open edX is implemented mostly through Python in the server and Javascript in the browser.</p>
<p>Its architecture is designed to be modular, readily enabling new components to be developed and plugged in.</p>
<p>The code of the platform is located at <a href="https://github.com/edx/">github.com/edx/</a>. The main repository is “edx-platform”, and it covers the LMS and the Studio authoring tool (or CMS). It also includes XBlocks, the courseware components.</p>
<p>The software is written in Python, Ruby and Javascript, with several extensions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Django + Mako</li>
    <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
    <li>NodeJS</li>
    <li>Coffeescript</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
</ul>
<p>A driving principle of Open edX is scalability. A number of modules and their respective databases can be run on separate machines and scaled easily.</p>


&nbsp;
<h2>6. COMPONENTS </h2>
<p>Open edX consists of multiple components. The main ones are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>LMS (Learning Management System): students’ view
        <br>
        <p>It is the part of Open edX that students interact with. It displays content and runs quizzes and interactive apps. The LMS provides user registration, progress tracking, grading, and forums. Data storage: courses are saved in MongoDB and student data in MySQL.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Studio course authoring tool or CMS (Content Management System): authors’ view
        <br>
        <p>EdX Studio presents a friendly graphical user interface. You can upload and arrange lectures into logical units, post course materials, create quizzes and assessments, etc.</p><p>The types of exercises that instructors can create are virtually limitless. Aside from the multiple-choice, text or equation input types, Open edX integrates LTI components, customized Javascript as well as tools such as Google Instant Hangout and even a Molecule Editor (read <a href="http://ca.readthedocs.org/en/latest/exercises_tools/create_exercises_and_tools.html">the full list</a>). Note that if you wish to use Hangouts you may need to ask Google for permission and to whitelabel your website.</p><p>Like the LMS, Studio stores its content in MongoDB and MySQL.</p>
    </li>
    <li>CS Comments Service
        <br>
        <p>A server-side Ruby application that supports voting, nested comments and instructors’ endorsements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>XBlocks
        <br>
        <p>A course is made of XBlock learning components, which can be created by third parties to extend Open edX’s functionality.</p><p>Other optional components of Open edX are:</p>
    </li>
    <li>XQueue Service
        <br>
        <p>Defines an interface for the LMS to communicate with external checker services. For example, when a student submits a problem in the LMS, it is sent to XQueue in order for it to be processed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>XServer
        <br>
        <p>XServer accepts student code submissions from the LMS and runs the code using courseware graders.</p>
    </li>
    <li>edX-ora (Open Response Assessor)
        <br>
        <p>It takes a submission from an XQueue installation that can be graded either by peers, staff or machine learning software. Results are then returned to the LMS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Discern
        <br>
        <p>It is an API that allows to grade responses using artificial intelligence and machine learning-based automated textual and numeric classification. It is a high-performance, scalable solution that can effectively help students learn by allowing them to receive instant feedback for their work.</p>
    </li>
    <li>EASE (Enhanced AI Scoring Engine)
        <br>
        <p>A library that allows for machine learning-based classification of textual content. This is also useful for tasks such as scoring student essays.</p>
    </li>
    <li>edinsights
        <br>
        <p>This is a development version of a Django + Mongo framework for creating simple, pluggable analytics based on streaming events.</p>
    </li>
    <li>notifier
        <br>
        <p>Sends daily digests of new content to users who are subscribed to a given forum.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Every day we see more functionalities being added to the Open edX software. The features listed above are just the beginning.

&nbsp;
<h2>7. WAYS TO EXTEND OPEN EDX </h2>
<p>There are five ways to extend Open edX:</p>
<ol>
    <li>XBlocks
        <br>
        <p>Form edX’s component architecture which allows course creators to integrate elements from all sorts of web services in order to expand the platform’s functionalities using Python. They can be written to store and present all sorts of data (read more below).</p>
    </li>
    <li>LTI components
        <br>
        <p>Open edX supports LTI 1.1 and LTI 2.0 is in development. It is the external standard and applicable to platforms such as Canvas. See the available apps at <a href="https://www.eduappcenter.com/">eduappcenter.com</a>
        <p>The following is an overview of how to integrate LTI components. Once we have the required authentication parameters such as the consumer key and consumer secret, in addition to the launch URL and possibly context and resource link IDs (depending on the LTI tool), we may do so by logging into “Advanced Settings” under “Settings” on Studio. Enter “[“lti”]” as a Policy Value under the “advanced modules” Policy Key.</p>
        <p>Under “lti_passports”, add the ID, key and secret following this format: [“&lt;id&gt;:&lt;key&gt;:&lt;secret&gt;”]. Additional authentication parameters will depend on your LTI tool provider’s needs. Piazza’s integration provides <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/piazza-materials/LTI-Setup/AddingPiazzatoedX.pdf">a great example</a>.</p>
        <p>Set its visibility to public and start using it by clicking on “View resource in a new window”.</p>
    </li>
    <li>JSinput
        <br>
        <p>This extension is good to grade and display new types of problems. Unlike XBlocks, JSinput runs on the browser which means that instructors can take advantage of it without modifying the platform on the server.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Hacking on core code
        <br>
        <p>You can change anything, although it is not easy. As stated in “4. Open Source Initiative”, you must keep Open edX’s <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL license</a> in mind. </p>
    </li>
    <li>Custom grader
        <br>
        <p>Grading does not necessarily have to take place on the main server. This allows the instructors to return and render elaborate dynamically created HTML blocks as answers as opposed to just letters or numbers.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the extension points used, difficulties and costs will appear.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Five-ways-to-extend-edX">This page on GitHub</a> summarizes all of the details.</p>
<p>UC Berkeley offers a good example of what adding extensions to edX is like. Their instructors and students use HTML5, JavaScript and Python to add new functionalities to courses. <a href="https://berkeleyx.berkeley.edu/wiki/">Berkeley’s wiki</a> has more information.</p>


&nbsp;
<h2>8. XBLOCK – THE MAGIC ARCHITECTURE </h2>
<p>One of the largest successes of Open edX technology is the XBlock architecture. Designed by third-party developers and used to create new courseware components –such as a video player, an interactive Javascript feature or a discussion forum– XBlocks can be reused across courses and shared with the community.</p>
<p>In other words, an XBlock is an extensible system written in Python that processes users’ input, stores any form of content, displays it, etc.</p>
<p>An example is edX’s Annotation feature. It essentially introduces a new paradigm in online learning by allowing for contextual commentaries and conceptual tagging of media fragments inside online courses. HarvardX recently introduced digital annotations to “Poetry in America: Whitman”, a course that <a href="http://iblstudios.com/?p=1799">“[made] the study of poetry a conversation instead of a solitary endeavor”</a>.</p>
<p>In our opinion, these are some of the best XBlocks:
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/mitodl/edx-sga">Staff Graded Assignment</a>
        <br>
        <p>Students are invited to upload documents as a way to encapsulate their work on their assignments. Instructors download the files and grade them.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/edx-solutions/xblock-mentoring">Mentoring</a>
        <br>
        <p>It automates the workflow of real-life mentoring within an edX course. It supports free-form answers, multiple choice and response questions, rating scales and progression tracking</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/edx-solutions/xblock-drag-and-drop">Drag and Drop</a>
        <br>
        <p>Students are required to drag and drop text or images into different sections as specified by the assignment.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/edx-solutions/xblock-image-explorer">Image Explorer</a>
        <br>
        <p>It allows display tool tips of an image within the course content. See <a href="https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/List-of-XBlocks">a more complete list</a> as well as <a href="http://xblock.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">the official explanation of the XBlock architecture</a>.</p>
    </li>
</ol>


&nbsp;
<h2>9. CREATING COURSES WITH EDX STUDIO </h2>
<p>The edX Studio tool is a graphical user interface for course creators. Multiple instructors can work on a course together.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, building and running an edX course is not an easy task.</p>
<p>The 353-page document titled <a href="http://files.edx.org/Getting_Started_with_Studio.pdf">“Getting Started with edX Studio”</a> describes, in detail, how one may manage Open edX’s authoring tool. See <a href="http://ca.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">the online version</a>.</p>
<p>A summarized guide (32 pages) for creating online courses with edX that was written by Anant Agarwal, the president of edX, is located <a href="http://files.edx.org/Overview_of_Creating_an_Online_Course-V1.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a great self-paced course designed to walk you through the process of planning, building and running your own online course. It is a hidden gem. Register on a private site within <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX.org</a> called <a href="https://edge.edx.org">edge.edX.org</a> to view it.</p>
<p>Additionally, BerkeleyX provides <a href="https://berkeleyx.berkeley.edu/wiki/lecturing">a good summary</a> of how you may record lectures for your courses using tablets and other tools. As they say, anything besides “plain old passive Powerpoint slides”.</p>


&nbsp;
<h2>10. TEST PLATFORMS </h2>
<p>Open edX creators offer a sandbox website that is intended to be a playground for students and course authors. It has a demo course, and it is rebuilt every week with its latest version. This means that if you create a course on the sandbox on a given week, it will not necessarily be there by the next.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://sandbox.edx.org">LMS</a> and <a href="http://studio.sandbox.edx.org">Studio (the CMS)</a>.</p>
<p>The accounts are dummy. The user email is <a href="mailto:honor@example.com">honor@example.com</a> and the password is “edx”.</p>
<p>Another possibility is to use the edX Studio tool without installing it from scratch by <a href="http://iblstudios.com/contact-us/">contacting us</a> so we can give you access to our test platform.</p>
<p>Two pluses: we won’t delete your test courses every week and we will give you initial instructions about how you can build them.</p>
    

&nbsp;
<h2>11. DEVELOPERS’ CORNER </h2>
<p>A good site to find notes and documentation for developers, researchers and course staff is <a href="http://docs.edx.org/">docs.edX.org</a>.</p>
<p>Another key document is the <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">edX Research Guide</a>.</p>
